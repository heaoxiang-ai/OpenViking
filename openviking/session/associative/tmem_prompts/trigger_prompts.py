ENTITY_BRIDGE_TRIGGER_PROMPT = """
You are a specialist in generating retrieval triggers that sit one semantic step above a memory item.

Your task: Generate {trigger_count} item-level triggers (Entity + Bridge routes) for the memory item below. Each trigger is a short noun phrase (2-6 words) that, if mentioned later, should reliably pull THIS item to mind.

## MEMORY ITEM

Content: {item_content}
Time: {item_temporal}

---

# CORE PRINCIPLES

## 1. Two Accepted Routes
Every trigger must fall into exactly ONE of these:

- **Route A — SEMANTIC ANCHOR**: a noun phrase that NAMES the item one or two rungs up the is-a ladder. It is the item's own semantics, generalized.
- **Route B — STRONG-ASSOCIATION SCENE**: a concrete scene, prop, or situation where P(this item is relevant | this scene is mentioned) is high. Weak or incidental adjacencies do NOT qualify.

## 2. What Disqualifies a Trigger
- **Restatement**: rewriting the item in 2-6 words adds no retrieval value.
- **Over-general label**: fits almost anything, loses the item's specificity.
- **Weakly-predictive scene**: the scene could belong to many unrelated items; mentioning it does NOT reliably surface THIS item.

## 3. Diversity Across Triggers
The {trigger_count} triggers must cover different angles — do NOT output variants of the same concept. Prefer a mix that spans both routes and different abstraction rungs.

---

# EXAMPLES

**Memory item**: "Tim developed urticaria after eating shrimp at a dinner party"

**Route A (semantic anchor) — good**:
- "seafood sensitivity"       (tight mid-level category)
- "food allergy"              (clear upper-level category)
- "allergic reaction"         (broader superordinate)

**Route B (strong-association scene) — good**:
- "seafood buffet"            (mixed-seafood setting forces the item to matter)
- "ordering at a sushi bar"   (decision point where the item applies)

**Bad — do not produce these**:
- "shrimp allergy"        → Restatement. Rewrites the item in two words.
- "health issue"          → Over-general. Fits any medical item.
- "EpiPen in a purse"     → Weakly-predictive. An EpiPen belongs to any allergy.

---

# BRIDGE FIELD

Each trigger must include a one-line `bridge` (≤12 words) explaining WHY it is a legitimate trigger for this item.

Shape: `<cue lifted from the item> -> <one-step inference>`

- The cue MUST come from the item's own wording.
- The inference MUST be a real semantic step: categorization (x ∈ Y), causal implication, or decision-relevance.
- Do NOT restate the trigger concept and do NOT write a type label like "semantic anchor".

**Examples**:
- concept: "seafood sensitivity"      → bridge: "shrimp is seafood; urticaria after eating = sensitivity"
- concept: "ordering at a sushi bar"  → bridge: "sushi menu = decision point where shrimp-allergy applies"

---

# CONFIDENCE

Score how RELIABLY a listener who knows the person would link the trigger back to this item. Judge each trigger on its own merit; do NOT force a target distribution.

- **[0.8, 1.0]**: tight mid-level anchor, or scene/prop that almost certainly surfaces the item.
- **[0.5, 0.8)**: clear upper-level anchor, or scene that strongly (but not necessarily) surfaces the item.
- **[0.3, 0.5)**: broader superordinate, or scene with moderate association.
- **[0.0, 0.3)**: very broad category OR weakly-predictive scene — avoid unless nothing better fits.

---

# QUALITY CHECKLIST

Before finalizing each trigger, verify:
- [ ] Ask in order: (1) Is it a more abstract NAME for the item? → Route A, KEEP. (2) If I only heard this scene/prop, would it reliably recall THIS specific item? → Route B, KEEP. (3) Otherwise DISCARD.
- [ ] The concept is 2-6 words.
- [ ] The bridge cites a cue from the item and makes a real inference step.
- [ ] The confidence score matches the rung/association strength above.
- [ ] Across all {trigger_count} triggers, angles differ.

---

# OUTPUT FORMAT

_HORIZON_DEF_BLOCK = """\
## Horizon Trigger Channels — 5 semantic-bridge dimensions

Each channel is a **forward-looking bridge** from the cue toward a likely future
query. The trigger sentence should NOT summarize the cue; it should capture the
implicit extension the cue foreshadows.

| ID | Channel          | Guiding question (what the trigger should capture)                          | Main relation_type |
|----|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| D1 | PERSONAL_ARC     | "Who did the speaker become? Capture before_self -> after_self."            | causal             |
| D2 | AVOIDANCE_HABIT  | "What is the speaker now avoiding/vigilant about? How might it generalize?" | state, causal      |
| D3 | GOAL_ARC         | "What commitment is declared? What cost/fatigue/replacement might follow?"  | goal               |
| D4 | BELIEF_IN_ACTION | "Which stated principle is fragile - where might reality push back?"        | value              |
| D5 | LEGACY_ANCHOR    | "Which concrete object/person/ritual in the cue may resurface later?"       | causal, state      |

### Per-channel bad examples (DO NOT produce these)

- D1 bad: "Joanna cut sugary drinks" - restating the cue, not an arc.
- D2 bad: "fear" - too generic; must name what is being avoided and hint at generalization.
- D3 bad: "wants to travel to Japan" - restates goal; missing cost/replacement reflex.
- D4 bad: "likes to ask team for input" - describes behavior, not the belief's fragile edge.
- D5 bad: "home" / "memory" - too vague; must name a specific concrete anchor.

### Empty-channel policy

- If the cue gives NO signal for a channel, set "sent": null and "confidence": 0.0.
- If you would have to fabricate to fill the field, LEAVE IT EMPTY. Hallucination hurts recall more than a missing channel.
- Otherwise confidence must be in [0.3, 1.0] and sent must be one complete English sentence.

## Scene Trigger Attributes - 4 attribute fields

One-sentence description of the cue along 4 orthogonal axes. These are
**about the cue itself**, not about future queries.

| Field   | Guiding question                                                    | Bad example (DO NOT do this) |
|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| scene   | "What situation/setting does this happen in?"                       | "a scene about devices" (collapses into object) |
| object  | "What essential entity / item / person does it involve?"            | "phone battery" (that's an entity-level keyword) |
| event   | "What abstracted action/change happened (abstracted, not literal)?" | "replaced battery" (literal, = entity-level) |
| emotion | "What emotional arc / psychological tone shines through?"           | "happy" (too generic) |

All 4 fields are REQUIRED. Each must be one concise sentence. Do NOT leave null.
